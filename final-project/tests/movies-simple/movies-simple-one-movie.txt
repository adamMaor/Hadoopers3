Cusack and Zuniga are great in early roles.	review/text: How this movie slipped past me until almost 2000 I'll never know. My passion for going to movies has always been sporadic, with large gaps of time with either fanatacism or apathy towards  what type of movies were being put out. 1985 was when my interest was rekindled with boat loads of movies addressing my age group  I must have just missed this one. I'm a huge fan of John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga, the latter of who ranks way atop my all time fave females list. Having seen most of Zuniga's relatively low output of work (I refused to lower myself to watching "Melrose Place" just to catch a glimpse of her), being told about this movie caught me way off guard, since this is both her and Cusack at their earliest. This was the first movie they both had significant dialogue and camera time and they both make the most of it. In an era where most teen/post teen flicks were covered by the likes of John Hughes, director Rob Reiner in only his second film hits a home run. Hughes movies are awesome. They are time capsule candidates for many reasons. But "The Sure Thing" connects in a totally different way with its similarly aged cast and settings, giving us a movie that highlights a slew of mixed feelings by Cusack's and Zuniga's characters, some spoken, many unspoken until push comes to shove. I don't know what it is about Zuniga, but she's always had a strong appeal to me. Maybe it's because she comes across as the unpretentious type that every guy likes. In "Sure Thing" she wavers between that personna and the "in love with being in love" dedicated to her studies and her future husband who schools on the opposite west coast where Zuniga and Cusack's cross country Christmas time journey is taking them. What starts off as a case of two complete opposites that drive each other crazy turns into an epiphany of feelings for each other despite their differences. By the movies end, it's safe to say that each has adopted a little of what makes the other person tick. Zuniga learns to loosen up a bit, while Cusack learns not to be too shallow. Reiner touches on genuine feelings and concerns of the college age characters, and from beginning to end paints a background of college experiences that anyone who's gone through it can totally relate to. He may get a little hokey or over-the-top in some scenes, in painting the straight laced extent of Zuniga's character for example. But his use of the surrounding character actors only helps soliidify the story in the foreground. "Sure Thing" Nicolette Sheridan, as the reason for Cusack's quest west, peaked in the gorgeous category with this movie. She's an abolute doll, a mere shadow of her "Desperate Housewives" character of the future. Viveca Lindfors, Tim Robbins and Anthony Edwards (during his "Nerd" years) all give major contributions with minimal screen time. Lindfors English Class Professor character and classroom setting put you in an authentic college atmosphere in bookend scenes that remind you by the movies' end that these are two young adults that are still evolving in school and in life. The closing scene is at the top of my all time romantic moments in the movies. A movie that's easy to watch repeatedly.

Some 20 years later I had the opportunity to view it again, and I still love it. It's storyline is timeless as is it's humor. I found the exchanges between the two lead characters so natural and FUNNY. It is still one of my very favorite movies of all time. John Cusak is fabulous!! Please see it. If you want to feel good, it's a movie that will help you get there.

There are so many great lines in this movie!  One of my favorite scenes is when Gib explains to Allison:  &quot;You know what you are, Allison?  You're repressed.&quot;  The scene that follows is hilarious, and finally ends with: &quot;Driving with a load not properly tied down?&quot;  Do yourself a favor and see this movie.  Between John Cusack, Anthony Edwards, and Gib's &quot;ladies' man&quot; roommate, this movie is an absolute scream.

Just complete classic and don't think I didn't notice the reference to Cassiopia in the "Serendipity" movie. I still think that "Gibb, Gibb...come to California" is the best quote although there are numerous quotable quotes that I drive my family nuts with constantly!

Why this movie has not been re-released on tape or DVD is beyond me. Rob Reiner and the cast were at their best here. Crisp dialoge, great cast and a lot of funny 80s references that are fun to  look back on. Cusack and Zuniga bounce off each other perfectly and the  ending scene gives me goose bumps to this day.  When ever I take a road  trip, I have to say I think of Tim Robbins singing, Button up your  Overcoat. Great cameo! I reccomend this to anyone who was in school in the  80s or anyone who enjoys sharp comedy. A cut above the usualy teen flicks  of the 80s.

I have been watching this movie over and over in the past ten years and actually need to replace it from wear. Great performances, cast and a story about 20-somethings that does not talk down  to it's audience. Rob Reiner's second best movie (&quot;Spinal Tap&quot; is  still tops).<p>John Cusack has never been funnier and a terrific cameo by  Tim Robbins.<p>And to all those who have seen and appreciate this movie:  Always check your junk food for the USRDA of Riboflavin.

I've watched it over and over again, and still laugh as hard.  Be advised portions are pretty adult, but the underlying theme is that real love is worth the wait, the  sacrifice, and sometimes comes quite unexpected.  The only reason that I  didn't give it 5 stars is that you need to leave somewhere to go for  &quot;Something about Mary..&quot;
